properties:
    irq-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        The gpio interrupt ping.
        The pin is active low.

    cpi:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 1200
      description: |
        Sensor CPI (Counts Per Inch).
        From 200 to 3200 cpi, step size is 200 cpi.
        Default is 1200 cpi.

    evt-type:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 0
      description: |
        Input event type.
        Default is 0 (EV_SYN).
        See include/zephyr/dt-bindings/input/input-event-codes.h

    x-input-code:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 0
      description: |
        Input event code for X axis.
        Default is 0 (REL_X).
        See include/zephyr/dt-bindings/input/input-event-codes.h

    y-input-code:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 1
      description: |
        Input event code for Y axis.
        Default is 1 (REL_Y).
        See include/zephyr/dt-bindings/input/input-event-codes.h

    swap-xy:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: Swap X and Y axis.

    invert-x:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: Invert X axis.

    invert-y:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: Invert Y axis.

    force-awake:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: |
        Force the sensor to stay awake (RUN mode).
        This consumes more power but provides better responsiveness.

      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: |
        Force the sensor to use 4ms polling rate in RUN mode.
        Default is 8ms.
        This consumes more power but provides better responsiveness.
        Only effective when force-awake is enabled.

    smart-algorithm:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: |
        Enable the smart algorithm (datasheet feature) to improve tracking.

    run-downshift-time-ms:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        Time (ms) in RUN mode before downshifting to REST1.

    rest1-downshift-time-ms:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        Time (ms) in REST1 mode before downshifting to REST2.

      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        Time (ms) in REST2 mode before downshifting to REST3.
        Default is 17000ms.
